## Description:

- __Functional Binary Search Tree.scm__ defines a binary search tree data type along with some list like functions.
- __Prefix Simplification.scm__ defines a simplifcation algorithm to use when simplifying all prefix expressions. Expressions take the form of a binary search tree with the root as the operator and the left and right subtrees as the operands. The algorithm recursively simplifies the binary search tree.

## How to build the software

Scheme compiles at run time


## How to use the software

Run with Dr. Racket or any other scheme/common-lisp interpretor


## How the software was tested

Testing was completed by using outlier-like input arguments in order to stress
test the simplification algorithm and binary search tree behavior.


## Known bugs and problem areas

None.
